## 💡 Ideas & Feature Requests

Got an idea on how to bring the hardware cost down? Or an enhancement to improve the durability or sustainability of the unit? Any other ideas are also highly welcome.

**Our Process:**
1. **Discuss:** Start by posting your concept on our [Ideas Discussion Page](#link). This allows the community to brainstorm, refine, and validate the idea.
2. **Propose:** Once the idea has gained traction and a clear direction, you or a maintainer can formalize it by submitting an issue using our [Feature Request Template](#link).

## 📚 Maintenance Files

Great hardware requires great manuals. 

If you have any suggested improvements for our manuals, SOPs, or command protocols, please submit an issue using the [Maintenance Issue Template](#link).

## 📃 Documentation
Our primary technical documentation lives on a Docusaurus site in a separate repository. This is still a work in progress. 
  > 📌 **Note:** If you want to improve the docs, please head over to the [OpenRefill Documentation Repo](#link) and submit an issue using their `documentation_issue` template.

## 🌍 Community & Localization

### Help the Community (Q&A)
One of the most valuable ways to contribute is by helping others. 
* Visit our [Q&A Discussion Page](#link). 
* If you see a question that you can answer, please jump in! Sharing your specific use cases or "lessons learned" helps build our collective knowledge base.

### Build the Community in Your Country
Rally the troops and spread the word! We are actively looking for local knowledge regarding:
* Gathering and reporting on local **labeling requirements**.
* Gathering and reporting on local **metrology (measurement) requirements**.

If you can provide insights for your region, please start a thread in your country page.
