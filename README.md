# OpenRefill 
An open-source platform for refill and reuse dispenser systems. 


## The Mission
We want to accelerate the shift away from single-use plastic by enabling open, low-cost refill dispensing systems, through open-source designs, shared standards, and collaboration. Our focus is on personal care products (shampoos, conditioners, soaps, etc) that are sold to developing markets in sachets.
